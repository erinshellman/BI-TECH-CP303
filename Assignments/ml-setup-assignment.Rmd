#  Creating a machine learning analysis plan

## Instructions

If you haven't already, download [`forestfires.tsv data`](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1105384/files/39712993) and [documentation](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1105384/files/39712997/download?wrap=1). Use the `caret` package to prepare the forest fire data for a machine learning analysis. When you finish preparing the data, save your script and upload it to Canvas.

1. Make at least one new feature and plot it against the burn area. From visual inspection does there appear to be a relationship between the new feature and the burn area?
    
2. Use `createDataPartition` to split 80% of the forest fire data into a training set.

3. Use `preProcess` to prepare your data for analysis. What, if any, variables were removed for near zero variance?
