# Unsupervised Learning II: Clustering

**Problem statement: A granting agency wants to identify colleges that have high numbers of low-income, and first generation college attendees to give those colleges additional funding.**

1. In the clustering tutorial, we used k-means clustering to identify 3 clusters of colleges using these criteria. 
    
    **A.** Replicate this analysis using the code in the tutorial to generate those 3 clusters and append the cluster levels to the `college_features` dataset. If you are getting an error using mutate, use the following code instead:
    ```{r, eval = F}
    college_features$cluster = kmeans_cluster$cluster
    ```
    
    **B.** What is the median family income for each cluster (**hint:** see `kmeans_cluster$centers` from the tutorial)?
 
    **C.** Subset the colleges_features dataset on the cluster with the lowest `family_income_median`, call this new data grant_candidates. **Note:** in the tutorial, grant_candidates were from Cluster 1, you could find that a different cluster from your analysis has the lowest `family_income_median` when you look at `kmeans_cluster$centers`.
    
    **D.**  How many universities are in the cluster of grant receivers? 

2. Upon review youâ€™re informed that there are too many universities receiving grants. The granting agency really likes the cluster approach but suggests you make 5 clusters instead of 3.

    **A.** Redo the k-means analysis above but create 5 clusters instead of 3. **Note:** If you appended cluster onto your `college_features` dataset, make sure to remove it before redoing the k-means analysis.
    
    **B.** Again subset the data on the cluster with the lowest `family_income_median`. How many universities will receive a grant now? What is the median and range of `family_income_median` of these universities and how does it compare to your answers in Question 1?
    
    **C.** You will likely find that there were two clusters out of the five with low but similar `family_income_median`. Among these two clusters, what else determined which cluster these universities were assigned to (**hint:** look at the centers again)? Based on those other variables, do you think we made the correct decision to distribute grants considering only `family_income_median`?
 

3. Hierarchical clustering: Part of the grant is to reformulate curriculums to better match top ten universities.

    **A.** Subset your colleges dataset using the following code. The !is.na(sat_verbal_quartile_1) removes universities that do not have SAT admission criteria, so we are looking at similar degree-granting universities. What other criteria are we using to subset? 

    ```{r, eval = F}
    grant_colleges = colleges %>% filter(
    (!is.na(sat_verbal_quartile_1) & family_income_median < 40000 & median_earnings < 30000)
  )
    top_ten_schools = colleges %>% filter(top_ten == TRUE)
  
    heir_analysis_data = rbind(grant_colleges, top_ten_schools)
    ```
    
    **B.** Replicate the heirarchical clustering from the tutorial comparing major percentages using `heir_analysis_data` dataset. Which universities are the most different from the top ten schools in terms of majors?
  
    **C.** How else can we compare the grantee schools to the top ten schools? Explore using any of the methods we learned in this class.


```{r, eval = F, include = F}

colleges = read_tsv("../data/colleges.tsv")

college_features = colleges %>% select(institution_name,
first_gen_share, poverty_rate, family_income_median,

kmeans_cluster = kmeans(select(college_features,

new_kmeans_cluster = kmeans(select(college_features, -institution_name, -top_ten), 5)
college_features$cluster = new_kmeans_cluster$cluster
final_grantees = college_features %>% filter(cluster == 2)


major_perc = heir_analysis_data %>% select(institution_name,
top_ten, contains("_major_perc")) %>%
na.omit()


euclidean = dist(select(major_perc, -institution_name, -top_ten), method = "euclidean")
# hierarchical clustering
hier = hclust(euclidean)

hier$labels = major_perc$institution_name

ggdendrogram(hier, rotate = TRUE, size = 2)

# merge back in the top ten information
dendro_data = dendro_data(hier) 

dendro_data$labels = dendro_data$labels %>%
  left_join(select(college_features, institution_name, top_ten),
            by = c("label" = "institution_name"))

ggplot(segment(dendro_data)) + geom_segment(aes(x = x,
y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) + geom_text(data = label(dendro_data),
aes(label = label, x = x, y = 0, hjust = 0,
color = top_ten), size = 2) + coord_flip() +
scale_y_reverse(expand = c(0.25, 0)) + theme_minimal() +
theme(legend.position = "bottom")
